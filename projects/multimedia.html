    <h2>Video Rendering</h2>
    <p>video rendering is a dynamic process that combines the raw elements of a video project into a final product that viewers can play back on a display. Picture assembling a jigsaw puzzle. Each piece of that puzzle could represent a different element in the video. When all these puzzle pieces are correctly connected, we get a full, detailed picture or, in this case, a watchable video.</p>

    <p>BLENDER</p>
    <p>Blender is a powerful open-source 3D creation suite that supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline, including modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, and motion tracking.</p>

    <p>SOLAR SYSTEM ANIMATION</p>
    <p>This project features a 3D animated model of the solar system created entirely in Blender. Rather than modeling each planet by hand, the animation was developed mainly through Python scripting and the use of external templates.
         By automating the positioning, movement, and rotation of celestial bodies, I was able to simulate orbital motion with greater accuracy and efficiency‚Äîespecially helpful as a beginner. The result is a dynamic and visually appealing solar system animation that showcases the capabilities of code-based animation in Blender.</p>

    <h2>Rotoscoping</h2>
    <p>A frame-by-frame animation done using Adobe After Effects, showing movement enhancement and artistic tracing.</p>
  
    <p>1 min Rotoscoping </p>
    <p>This project involved creating a 1-minute rotoscope animation using Adobe After Effects. The process included tracing over video footage to create a stylized animation that enhances the original movement. The final product showcases the fluidity of motion and the artistic interpretation of the source material.</p>
